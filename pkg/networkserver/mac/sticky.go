// The RxParamSetup, RxTimingSetup, TxParamSetup and DlChannel MAC commands
// use the sticky answer mechanism:
// After an end device receives a {Command}Req, it will piggy back the
// associated {Command}Ans on every subsequent uplink until a class A downlink
// reaches the end device. This means that we will observe {Command}Ans
// even in the absence of a request. We should allow this, provided the
// previous uplink messages did contain a {Command}Ans as well.
// A corollary of the sticky answer mechanism is that we should not schedule
// {Command}Req if an {Command}Ans was found in the last uplink received
// from the end device, as we cannot distinguish between a sticky answer and
// a real answer for the new {Command}Req.
